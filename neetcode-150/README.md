## Usage

Each file contains method signatures with problem descriptions. Implement solutions and add test cases as needed.

```python
# Example implementation pattern
def problem_name(input_params):
    """
    Problem description and constraints
    """
    # Your solution here
    pass

# Add test cases
assert problem_name(test_input) == expected_output
```
